# 🤖 Robots with a Soul: Generative AI for Emotional Expression

This project demonstrates how to use Generative AI to help robots express human-like emotions using creative outputs like poems, gestures, and mood-based reactions.

## 🔍 Modules
- **Emotion Detection**: NLP-based analysis of input text to detect user's emotion.
- **Generative Expression**: Generates poems based on emotion.
- **Robot Expression Simulation**: Simulated hardware response (movement, voice, light).

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
